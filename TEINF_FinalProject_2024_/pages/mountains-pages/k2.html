        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chhogori, is the second-highest mountain in the world, standing at 8,611 meters above sea level. It is part of the Karakoram range and straddles the border between Pakistan and China. K2 is notorious for its challenging climbs and has been nicknamed the 'Savage Mountain' due to its difficult ascent and high fatality rate among climbers. The mountain's remote location and severe weather conditions contribute to its reputation as one of the most dangerous mountains to climb.</p>
