        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Golden Lady, also known as Gëlle Fra, is a war memorial located in Luxembourg City. Created by the Luxembourgish sculptor Claus Cito, it commemorates the thousands of Luxembourgers who volunteered for service in the armed forces of the Allied Powers during both World Wars and the Korean War. The monument holds deep historical significance and serves as a tribute to those who sacrificed for their country.</p>

          <li><strong>Sculptor:</strong>  Claus Cito, a native Luxembourger, created the three bronze figures.</li>
          <li><strong>Inauguration:</strong>  The monument was inaugurated in 1923.</li>
