        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Brandenburg Gate (German: Brandenburger Tor) is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin, Germany. It stands at the western end of the avenue Unter den Linden and is one of the best-known landmarks in the country.</p>
        
        <h3>Stats:</h3>
        <ul class="spec-list">
          <li><strong>Design:</strong> The gate was commissioned by Frederick William II and built between 1788 and 1791 by architect Carl G. Langhans. It was modeled after the Propylaea in Athens.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Composed of 12 Doric columns, the sandstone gate creates five portals. It stands approximately 20 meters high, 65 meters wide, and 11 meters deep.</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>The Brandenburg Gate has served as a symbol of both Germany's division and reunification. During the Cold War, it was part of the Berlin Wall, and it gained global prominence when U.S. President Ronald Reagan called for the wall s removal in 1987.</li>
          <li><strong>Restoration:</strong>Heavily damaged during World War II, the gate was restored in the late 1950s. It officially reopened in 2002 after further restoration efforts.</li>
